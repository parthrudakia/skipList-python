### skipList Data Structure implemented as a Dictionary using python.

#### About SkipList

##### SkipList: It is a data structure that can be used to implement data structures such as dictionaries and sets. It is a probabilistic data structure that allows for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. It works by maintaining a linked list of sorted elements, with additional links between elements at different levels that allow for faster traversal to the target element. The number of levels is determined by a random process, allowing the average time complexity of operations to approach O(log n), making skiplists a useful alternative to balanced search trees for certain use cases.
